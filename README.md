# New-York-Housing-Dashboard using MS Excel
##Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the New York housing market using an interactive dashboard. It focuses on identifying key trends in property types, average prices, locality-wise distribution, and broker performance. The goal is to provide clear insights for buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed real estate decisions.

##Dataset used: 
-<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/new-york-housing-market">Kaggle dataset</a>
-<a href ="https://github.com/MantrawadiSaiMeghana/New-York-Housing-Dashboard/blob/main/newyork%20housing%20dashboard.xlsx">Cleaned dataset</a>

##Questions:
-How many housing listings are available in New York?
-What is the distribution of property types (Condo, Co-op, House, Rental, etc.)?
-Which localities have the highest listings and price per sqft?
-What is the average price per square foot across New York?
-What is the average property size listed for sale?
-How does the average price vary by the number of bedrooms?
-Who is the top broker handling the maximum listings?

##Process: 
-Imported the New York housing dataset (listings, locality, price, size, property type, and broker information) into Excel using Power Query.
-Adjusted column data types (text, number, date) for consistency and cleaned the data by replacing nulls, and errors. Removed irrelevant or duplicate rows to retain only valid housing records.
-Loaded the cleaned dataset into Excel and derived additional features such as price per sqft and average property size. Built Pivot Tables to analyze property counts, pricing patterns, and locality-wise trends.
-Used interactive Pivot Charts (bar, line, pie) and added slicers for dynamic filtering by locality and property type, resulting in an insightful and user-friendly housing dashboard.
